## How to Contribute
In the spirit of open source software, **everyone** is encouraged to help
improve this project.

### Ways *you* can contribute:
* by [testing the software](http://mauroaperez.com/miamibudget)
* by [using the issue tracker][issue_tracker] for...
  * reporting bugs
  * suggesting new features
  * suggesting labels for our issues
* by improving the code through:
  * writing or editing documentation
  * writing test specifications
  * refactoring the code (**no patch is too small**: fix typos, add comments,
  clean up inconsistent whitespace).
  * reviewing [open Pull Requests][open_prs]
* by [donating to Code for America][donate]

### Reporting a bug or other issue
We use the GitHub issue tracker to track bugs and feature
requests. To submit a bug report or feature request:

1. **[Browse][issue_tracker] or [search][issue_search] our issues** to make
sure your issue hasn't already been submitted.

2. **[Submit an issue][new_issue]**.
If you're submitting a bug report, it's helpful to include any details that
may be necessary to reproduce the bug, including:

    - a screenshot
    - your operating system (Windows 7, Mac OSX 10.9.2, etc.)
    - your web browser and version (Internet Explorer 9, Chrome 27, etc.)
    - a stack trace of any errors encountered
    - your Ruby version (use `ruby -v` from the command line)

For developers, a bug report should ideally include a pull request with
failing specs.

### Help Wanted
Some issues in particular we'd be happy if contributors like yourself were
interested in fixing. Browse the issues [labelled `help wanted`][help_wanted]
and see if there's something there that you could fix.
